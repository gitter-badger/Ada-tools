# Ada Files
This project contains many Ada files that don't seem like they belong. They are for testing the command line program, since they are automatically copied to the output directory.
As much as possible, testing should be done in the unit tests, but it's still a good idea to run the command line on these files as an extra test, in the event there are bugs with this tool and not the library. This also helps test that the formatting of the tool is correct.
You can change the `launchSettings.json` file to set the command line arguments that VisualStudio will run the tool with. For running this tool directly from the command line for testing purposes, in the project directory run `dotnet run <arguments> --no-launch-profile`, where `<arguments>` are the arguments to this tool.
