# Ada Files
This project contains many Ada files that don't seem like they belong. They are for testing the command line program, since they are automatically copied to the output directory.
As much as possible, testing should be done in the unit tests, but it's still a good idea to run the command line on these files as an extra test, in the event there are bugs with this tool and not the library.
You can change the `launchSettings.json` file to set the command line arguments that VisualStudio will run the tool with.
